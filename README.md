Code for the react app can be found in the src folder of source code folder.  

Languages used: JSX, CSS and JavaScript  
JSX is much like HTML only but it can be used to display dynamic content unlike HTML.  

Libraries used: React.js  

HTML/JSX tags used: div, h1, h3, form, label, input, button, br, button, a, p, textarea.  
Most tags are given IDs and classNames and styles are added to these elements using CSS. The styles are added through the file index.css.  

React Logo is used at the top of the webpage. The logo file is logo.svg.  

Funcional Components are used in the app. The components are: App, Header, Navigator, Welcome, Loginform and Footer.  
All the components except App are separately defined and then called in the definition of App. Then the App component is exported. All this code is written in App.js.  

Finally all the files and libraries are imported in the file index.js where the react code is rendered to the DOM using reactDOM. That's how the react components are injected into the DOM and displayed on the webpage.
